# pp2PersonalPortfolioWebsite
My second portfolio project. (●'◡'●) 

## Description
I created a Personal Portfolio page using HTML & CSS, and one interactive function using JavaScript. My page features a not-too-serious about me, links to my project pathways, and a clickable fake email. First, I planned the project with a timeline. Then, I created a wireframe and got started with the HTML. I did my CSS alongside my HTML, and lastly added a JavaScript dark mode toggle button. I edited the red-lined code, and then commited it through the main branch. This project took a total of 4 hours to complete. 

## Code Explained
* Header: the header is fixed using position: fixed in CSS, and scrolls down to the section that is clicked on, using scrollIntoView in JavaScript. 
* Main: Main is divided into 3 <section>s. Some of the CSS styling for the paragraphs is right in the HTML! (hint: look for the bold tag)
* I <link>ed my styles.css to HTML, and used <script> to link script.js
* Semantic HTML was used throughout to make the site easy to read and accessible
* Media queries for laptop, tablet, and mobile devices change the body's font size, header, h1 font-size, and nav li margin.
* The toggle button changes the body's background color to black and font color to pink. ![SnowRabbitWowGIF](https://github.com/suz-ana-j/pp2PersonalPortfolioWebsite/assets/83844920/6b33a783-f8e9-4e25-8e6e-127ff514b1d4)

## How To Use
Click on the nav buttons to find that section of the page. Watch as my github links change to pink when hovered over, and click on the links to see my portfolio projects so far (including this one)! Send a fake email to my fake email address, and have fun ❤️

## Technologies
I'm learning more about Visual Studio Code with each new project. I used VS code for this project, but the process of commit and push origin main were different this time; I found buttons that pretty much do all of that for me!
I was able to write most of the code by myself, plus with some help from Ai. ![GoodMemoryGIF](https://github.com/suz-ana-j/pp2PersonalPortfolioWebsite/assets/83844920/bfc2f50f-6812-4e66-af23-19b664a81883)

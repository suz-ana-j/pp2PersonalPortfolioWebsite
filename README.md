# Personal Portfolio Website
My second portfolio project. (●'◡'●) 

## Description
I created a Personal Portfolio page using HTML & CSS, and one interactive function using JavaScript. My page features an about me, links to my project pathways, and a clickable fake email. First, I planned the project with a timeline. I created a wireframe and got started with the HTML. I did my CSS alongside my HTML, and lastly added a JavaScript dark mode toggle button. I edited the red-lined code, then commit through the main branch. 

## How it Works
* Header: the header is fixed using position: fixed in CSS, and scrolls down to the section that is clicked on, using scrollIntoView in JavaScript. 
* Main: Main is divided into 3 sections. Some of the CSS styling for the paragraphs is right in the HTML! (hint: look for the bold tag)
* I linked my styles.css to HTML, and used <script> to link script.js
* Semantic HTML was used throughout to make the site easy to read and accessible
* Media queries for laptop, tablet, and mobile devices change the body's font size, header, h1 font-size, and nav li margin.
* The toggle button changes the body's background color to black and font color to pink.
